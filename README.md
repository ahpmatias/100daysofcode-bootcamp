# 100 days of code Python Bootcamp
##### Course provided by Dr. Angela Yu, through Udemy

### Repo author: Anderson H. P. Matias

### Key comments:

#### The solutions provided in this repository are a combination of solutions to challenges, projects and exercises as I've followed along the course.
#### Given the first couple of weeks in the course had no version control and were more simple tasks for a better understanding of the concepts, there might be some folders that are less than complete and likely won't be further updated.
#### Capstone projects will be held in separate repositories, so that they are easier to find and given they are more complete and round solutions.
#### The last part of the course, with portfolio projects, won't be part of this repository.

#### This repository main goals are:
##### - Serve as practice for version control as the course progresses;
##### - Get more familiar with GitHub (or any git-based application) and how it is used;
##### - Serve as inspiration for fellow developers going through the course as well.
